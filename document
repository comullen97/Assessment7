When doing this assessment and I ran the inital node runtime.js function, I
had the initial readings of the append function having a 982.1202ms and 2.8614ms for the insert
function. I was expecting the append function with .push to run faster since .unshift has a longer run time
especially with larger array sizes. In the table however it is showing that
the insert function with the .unshift had a drastically longer runtime compared to
the append function, and it also got longer time as the array size grew.
